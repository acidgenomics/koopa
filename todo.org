* Development
** FIXME Bash shell now has activation issues inside of RStudio.
** TODO Add step to generate BAM and/or CRAM files from salmon, kallisto,
        bowtie2 output.
** TODO Shell is double activating, showing tmux sessions twice on Debian
        ARM dev machine.
** TODO Consider removing non-symlinked programs in /usr/local/bin on macOS.
** TODO JAVA_HOME need to support Homebrew OpenJDK on Linux.
** TODO Improve the consistency of Homebrew installs across macOS and Linux.
** TODO Consider linking '/etc/shells' on Linux, to enable easier configuration
        of Linuxbrew Zsh and/or Bash.
** TODO Terminal zsh autosuggestion colors are messed up in solarized mode.
** TODO Add support for nushell?
** TODO Consider prefixing with "command XXX" instead of using "unalias XXX".
** TODO Clone shallow during install...
** TODO R versioned unit test script in koopa.
        Our 'AcidDevTools::check()' needs to call 'devtools::test()' manually.
** TODO Consider not linking r-devel into /usr/local. If we change this,
        need to update r-devel Docker image to hard-code the PATH.
** TODO Improve completion support for all exported scripts.
** TODO Improve configuration of NPM, to store packages outside of '/usr/local'.
   > npm config get prefix
   Want something like:
   '/opt/koopa/opt/npm-packages'
** TODO Improve support for Void Linux.
        Detect admin group.
        Add support for configure-system.
** TODO Consider installing latest stable release by default for Docker images.
** TODO Minimal Linux base images should not include '.git' directories.
** TODO Need to run bfg to make dotfiles more compact?
** TODO Consider moving dotfiles under opt in a future update.
** TODO koopa install base should work on CentOS.
** TODO Add support for activation in fish shell.
** TODO Add support for activation in oil shell.
        This is likely too difficult due to POSIX-incompatibility...
** TODO Move website and installer from GitHub pages to Cloudfront.
** TODO Ensure koopa installs clean on a macOS system without Homebrew.
** TODO dotfiles installer needs to locate koopa install better?
** TODO Today bucket activation needs to relink if link is broken.
** TODO Add support for `r-devel` installation on Fedora.
** TODO Add support for Shiny Server installation on Fedora.
** TODO Work on Fix macOS install script for Catalina.
* Documentation
** TODO Need to systematically check all exported scripts for documentation.
** TODO Need to explain which programs are automatically supported and get
        activated by default more clearly.
