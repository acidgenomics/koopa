* Development
** TODO Consider not linking r-devel into /usr/local. If we change this,
        need to update r-devel Docker image to hard-code the PATH.
** TODO Add support for nushell?
** TODO Improve completion support for all exported scripts.
** TODO Improve configuration of NPM, to store packages outside of '/usr/local'.
   > npm config get prefix
   Want something like:
   '/opt/koopa/opt/npm-packages'
** TODO Improve support for Void Linux.
        Detect admin group.
        Add support for configure-system.
** TODO Consider installing latest stable release by default for Docker images.
** TODO Minimal Linux base images should not include '.git' directories.
** TODO Need to run bfg to make dotfiles more compact?
** TODO Consider moving dotfiles under opt in a future update.
** TODO koopa install base should work on CentOS.
** TODO Add support for activation in fish shell.
** TODO Add support for activation in oil shell.
        This is likely too difficult due to POSIX-incompatibility...
** TODO Move website and installer from GitHub pages to Cloudfront.
** TODO Ensure koopa installs clean on a macOS system without Homebrew.
** TODO dotfiles installer needs to locate koopa install better?
** TODO Today bucket activation needs to relink if link is broken.
** TODO Add support for `r-devel` installation on Fedora.
** TODO Add support for Shiny Server installation on Fedora.
** TODO Work on Fix macOS install script for Catalina.
* Documentation
** TODO Need to systematically check all exported scripts for documentation.
** TODO Need to explain which programs are automatically supported and get
        activated by default more clearly.
