* High priority
** TODO Boost version detection isn't working on Ubuntu.
** TODO Need to rethink our link approach, putting useful tools in top level bin.
    This mimics the approach of Homebrew, without linking into /usr/local.
    Should we not put ANY tools linked into /usr/local?
** TODO Need to reorganize pre-built app tarballs by processor architecture.
** TODO Rework our conda-based NGS utilites by locating the programs directly, rather than by activating conda inside a function.
** TODO Improve consistency of AWS functions.
    - Ensure that all input consistently requires 's3://' as prefix input.
    - Ensure that this is consistent for CLI parser to JSON...bucket API one
** TODO Improve 'koopa uninstall app' to support removal of specific previous versions.
    - Pass this in with '--version' argument.
    - Need to support removal of older app versions.
    - In the case where it's not current link in opt, don't remove the opt link.
** TODO Need to ensure 0775 permissions on coc packages:
    /opt/koopa/app/dotfiles/rolling/app/coc/extensions/node_modules
** TODO Add improved stack trace of error messages.
** TODO Before pushing changes, ensure sed with '--quiet' change is non breaking.
** TODO Syntactic naming functions need an option to also convert the extension to lowercase.
** TODO Shared install isn't setting user permissions recursively correctly.
    Need to ensure that '/opt/koopa' isn't owned by current user after install.
    We're seeing this currently on AWS EC2 instances.
** TODO Confirm that not all bash functions load on interactive session.
** TODO Rework 'koopa install XXX --reinstall' flag to 'koopa reinstall XXX' instead, similar to approach used in Homebrew.
** TODO Emacs version check is now failing on old MacBook.
** TODO texinfo check is now failing again on old MacBook.
    Seeing 6.7 instead of expected 6.8, due to another program dumping into /usr/local.
** TODO Need to remove 'install-dotfiles' link from koopa config at '~/.config/koopa'.
** TODO Improve install instructions on website to provide recommended default
   packages for Debian (apt) and Fedora (yum).
** TODO User permissions on Debian 11 clean install are 'admin:admin' instead
   of 'root:admin', which we're expecting. Need to fix.
** TODO Dotifles are not installing clean on fresh Debian 11 AMI.

** TODO Need a simple batch rename utility to convert file extension to
    lowercase. We may simply add this in a future update to syntactic engine.
** TODO photos_rename_exiftool needs to error on file input instead of
    directory more clearly.
** TODO Ensure that no dict arrays contain '$dict' variable usage inside the
    initial array call. This doesn't work in Bash. Double check this before
    merging develop branch.
* Medium priority
** TODO Add support for installing Adoptium Temurin OpenJDK 17.0.2 LTS.
** TODO Consider installing latest stable release by default for Docker images.
** TODO Consider linking '/etc/shells' on Linux, to enable easier configuration
    of Linuxbrew Zsh and/or Bash.
** TODO Add step to generate BAM and/or CRAM files from salmon, kallisto,
    bowtie2 output.
** TODO Consider reworking git installs to use shallow clones?
** TODO Today bucket activation needs to relink if link is broken.
** TODO Consider removing non-symlinked programs in /usr/local/bin on macOS.
** TODO Consider prefixing with "command XXX" instead of using "unalias XXX".
* Low priority
** TODO Consider putting pipx installs under versioned subdirectory.
** TODO Update of Bash via Homebrew will cause current session to exit.
** TODO Add support for fish shell. This involves a lot of work.
** TODO Add support for nushell. This involves a lot of work.
** TODO Run BFG to make dotfiles and koopa repos more compact?
* Documentation
** TODO Need to systematically check all exported scripts for documentation.
** TODO Need to explain which programs are automatically supported and get activated by default more clearly.
