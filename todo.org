* Development (high priority)
** TODO Need a simple batch rename utility to convert file extension to
    lowercase. We may simply add this in a future update to syntactic engine.
** TODO photos_rename_exiftool needs to error on file input instead of
    directory more clearly.
** TODO Ensure that no dict arrays contain '$dict' variable usage inside the
    initial array call. This doesn't work in Bash. Double check this before
    merging develop branch.
** TODO Consider reworking our conda-based NGS utilites by locating the programs
    directly, rather than by activating conda inside a function.
** TODO Consider creating a koopa::grep function, that calls ripgrep rg
    internally if installed (for speed).
** TODO conda base environment has been seen to stay active inside of RStudio
    terminal on some AWS AMI EC2 instances.
* Development (medium priority)
** TODO Consider installing latest stable release by default for Docker images.
** TODO Consider linking '/etc/shells' on Linux, to enable easier configuration
    of Linuxbrew Zsh and/or Bash.
** TODO Add step to generate BAM and/or CRAM files from salmon, kallisto,
    bowtie2 output.
** TODO Consider reworking git installs to use shallow clones?
** TODO Today bucket activation needs to relink if link is broken.
** TODO Consider removing non-symlinked programs in /usr/local/bin on macOS.
** TODO Consider prefixing with "command XXX" instead of using "unalias XXX".
* Development (low priority)
** TODO Add support for fish shell.
** TODO Add support for nushell.
** TODO Improve support for Void Linux.
    Detect admin group.
    Add support for configure-system.
** TODO Need to run bfg to make dotfiles more compact?
* Documentation
** TODO Need to systematically check all exported scripts for documentation.
** TODO Need to explain which programs are automatically supported and get
    activated by default more clearly.
** TODO Improve completion support for all exported scripts.
