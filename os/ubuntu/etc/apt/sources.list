## Main / Restricted (default)                                              {{{1
## =============================================================================

## Main:
## When you install Ubuntu, this is the repository enabled by default. The main
## repository consists of only FOSS (free and open source software) that can be
## distributed freely without any restrictions. Software in this repository are
## fully supported by the Ubuntu developers. This is what Ubuntu will provide
## with security updates until your system reaches end of life.

## Restricted:
## Ubuntu tries to provide only free and open source software but thatâ€™s not
## always possible specially when it comes to supporting hardware.
## The restricted repositories consists of proprietary drivers.

# deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ bionic main restricted
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ bionic-updates main restricted
# deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ bionic-updates main restricted
deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ bionic-security main restricted

## Universe                                                                 {{{1
## =============================================================================

## This repository also consists free and open source software but Ubuntu
## doesn't guarantee of regular security updates to software in this category.
## Software in this category are packaged and maintained by the community. The
## Universe repository has a vast amount of open source software and thus it
## enables you to have access to a huge number of software via apt package
## manager.

## N.B. Software from this repository is ENTIRELY UNSUPPORTED by the Ubuntu
## team. Also, please note that software in universe WILL NOT receive any
## review or updates from the Ubuntu security team.

## =============================================================================

## Multiverse contains the software that are not FOSS. Due to licensing and
## legal issues, Ubuntu cannot enable this repository by default and cannot
## provide fix and updates. It's up to you to decide if you want to use
