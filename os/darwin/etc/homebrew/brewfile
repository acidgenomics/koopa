# """
# Homebrew Bundle Brewfile.
# Updated 2020-11-13.
#
# LLVM:
# LLVM takes up 4 GB of disk space but is required for some Python packages.
# In particular, if we want to install umap-learn, this is now required.
#
# Little Snitch:
# 'little-snitch' cask currently requires manual follow-up installation:
# /usr/local/Caskroom/little-snitch/*/LittleSnitch-*.dmg
#
# PROJ/GDAL:
# Consider using 'osgeo-gdal' instead of regular 'gdal' brew. This one gets
# updated more regularly. However, I've found that the newer version can
# cause some R packages to fail to build from source.
#
# Rust:
# Use cargo to manage packages instead.
# Use the 'install-rust' script instead of Homebrew 'rustup-init'.
# Don't install 'rust' alongside 'rustup-init'.

# Consider:
# - fiji  # latest
# - onyx
# - oracle-jdk
# - wine-stable
#
# Requires authentication in 'Security & Privacy':
# - box-drive
# - virtualbox
#
# Removals:
# - 'foobar2000' cask was removed due to url protection.
# - 'macvim' cask overwrites 'vim' binary, so install manually instead.
# - 'skype-for-business' is potentially useful but starts up at login.
