# """
# Homebrew Bundle Brewfile.
# Updated 2020-12-18.
#
# LLVM:
# LLVM takes up 4 GB of disk space but is required for some Python packages.
# In particular, if we want to install umap-learn, this is now required.
#
# PROJ/GDAL:
# Consider using 'osgeo-gdal' instead of regular 'gdal' brew. This one gets
# updated more regularly. However, I've found that the newer version can
# cause some R packages to fail to build from source.
#
# Rust:
# Use cargo to manage packages instead.
# Use the 'install-rust' script instead of Homebrew 'rustup-init'.
# Don't install 'rust' alongside 'rustup-init'.
