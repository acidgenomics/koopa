Install Neovim.


CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:
    - Release: Full compiler optimisations and no debug information. Expect the
      best performance from this build type. Often used by package maintainers.
    - Debug: Full debug information; little optimisations. Use this for
      development to get meaningful output from debuggers like gdb or lldb. This
      is the default, if CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is not specified.
    - RelWithDebInfo ("Release With Debug Info"): Enables many optimisations and
      adds enough debug info so that when nvim ever crashes, you can still get a
      backtrace.
