    --organism="ORGANISM" --build="BUILD" --release="RELEASE"
    [--indexes="INDEXES"]

Install Ensembl genome build for bcbio.

required arguments:
    --organism
        Full latin name (e.g. "Homo sapiens").
        Pass this argument in quoted as a string.
    --build
        Genome build (e.g. "GRCh38").
    --release
        Release version (e.g. "96").

optional arguments:
    --indexes
        Aligners to index.
        Pass this argument in quoted as a string.
        Default: --indexes "bowtie2 seq star"
        Note: HISAT2 is disabled by default because it requires a lot of memory
        to index (e.g. >= 200 GB). This is intended to be run on a high
        performance cluster, but is often impractical on a virtual machine.
