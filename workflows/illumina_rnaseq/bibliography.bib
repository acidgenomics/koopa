@article{staedtler2013gender,
	Abstract = {CONTEXT: Correct gender assignment in humans at the molecular level is crucial in many scientific disciplines and applied areas.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Candidate gender markers were identified through supervised statistical analysis of genome wide microarray expression data from human blood samples (N = 123, 58 female, 65 male) as a training set. The potential of the markers to predict undisclosed tissue donor gender was tested on microarray data from 13 healthy and 11 cancerous human tissue collections (internal) and external datasets from samples of varying tissue origin. The abundance of some genes in the marker panel was quantified by RT-PCR as alternative analytical technology.
RESULTS: We identified and qualified predictive, gender-specific transcript markers based on a set of five genes (RPS4Y1, EIF1AY, DDX3Y, KDM5D and XIST).
CONCLUSION: Gene expression marker panels can be used as a robust tissue- and platform-independent predictive approach for gender determination.},

@article{karyagyna2010gender,
	Abstract = {Affymetrix microarrays measure gene expression based on the intensity of hybridization of a panel of oligonucleotide probes (probe set) with mRNA. The signals from all probes within a probe set are converted into a single measure that represents the expression value of a gene. This step diminishes the number of independently measured parameters and eliminates from consideration individual "good-working" probes. We propose a new feature selection algorithm (Probe Level Universal Search or PLUS algorithm) for probe-level analysis of gene expression datasets. The algorithm evaluates the intensities of perfect-match Affymetrix probes individually and selects probes that allow one to distinguish two given classes of samples. The algorithm was used to differentiate the samples according to their gender ("gender differentiation"). The universal gender differentiating set of 3' Gene Affymetrix microarray probes was selected; the set consists of 38 probes from XIST gene of X-chromosome and 17 probes from five Y-chromosome genes: RPS4Y1, EIF1A, DDX3Y, JARID1D and USP9Y. The selection procedure based on the probes selected by PLUS algorithm differentiates the sex chromosome karyotype of the sample, reveals samples with incorrect gender labels and samples from patients with hereditary syndromes or cancer-associated chromosome abnormalities.},

Because Sailfish entirely avoids mapping reads, a time-consuming step in all current methods, it provides quantification estimates much faster than do existing approaches (typically 20 times faster) without loss of accuracy. By facilitating frequent reanalysis of data and reducing the need to optimize parameters, Sailfish exemplifies the potential of lightweight algorithms for efficiently processing sequencing reads.},

@article{love2014deseq2,
	Abstract = {In comparative high-throughput sequencing assays, a fundamental task is the analysis of count data, such as read counts per gene in RNA-seq, for evidence of systematic changes across experimental conditions. Small replicate numbers, discreteness, large dynamic range and the presence of outliers require a suitable statistical approach. We present DESeq2, a method for differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of estimates. This enables a more quantitative analysis focused on the strength rather than the mere presence of differential expression. The DESeq2 package is available at http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html webcite.},
