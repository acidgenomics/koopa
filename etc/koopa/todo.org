* High priority
** TODO Consider adding 'koopa_delete_line' that uses sed with '\d' internally.
    Refer to recent sambamba bioconda recipe update as an example.
** TODO Icons are now wonky for doom-emacs using emacs 29.1.
** TODO Improve sunsetting of removed apps (e.g. python3.10) and update the system checks to support this.
    Consider rewriting the system checks in bash or python instead of R.
** TODO Add install support for bcftools
** TODO Check that installers work for an installation without sudo access. Can do this with the biocontainers Docker image.
** TODO Our system pruner should not prune conservative apps. This is the simplest way to avoid dependency issues.
** TODO Our app pruner will currently break some applications that have conservative dependencies. Need to rethink how to handle this.
** TODO The '--only-revdeps' flag should combine all reverse dependencies from the input apps, rather than looping.
** TODO Make apt sources configuration accessible to user on Debian.
** TODO Add install support for Quarto (on Linux).
** TODO Add install support for dash, ksh93, and tcsh.
** TODO Consider renaming 'openjdk' to 'temurin'.

** TODO Need to ensure our build scripts don't dump temporary files.
    - `~/.cabal`
    - `~/.cache`
    - `~/.cargo`
    - `~/.conda`
    - `~/.npm`
** TODO 'kdev' isn't setting prompt correctly inside Debian docker build.
** TODO Work on setting PKG_CONFIG_PATH during install calls to not include /usr/local.
    Need to get system paths and then strip out /usr/local from the PATH string.
** TODO 'koopa install r-packages' needs to be 'koopa install system r-packages'.
** TODO apptainer, aspera-connect, lmod, and docker-credential-pass aren't showing up in Linux system checks.
** TODO Ensure hadolint install cleans up ghcup.
    hadolint \~/.ghcup/tmp
    ensure this gets cleaned up...don't waste disk space.
    can we move this?
** TODO Disable Ubuntu MOTD spam.
    sudo pro config set apt_news=false
    /etc/default/motd-news
    Switch 'ENABLED=1' to 'ENABLED=0'.

** TODO Consider hardening PATH in koopa bash header to /usr/bin and /bin only.
** TODO Create a recipe solver that walks across the JSON file and puts all apps in order of installation automatically.
** TODO grep alias is messing up if grep isn't installed.
    only alias grep if ggrep is installed
** TODO Don't let app install proceed unless all build and other dependencies defined in app JSON are present, with the current version.
** TODO Use app json during koopa_activate_opt_prefix (rename to app_prefix) usage.
    Can we retire the usage of opt_prefix entirely in our configuration scripts?
** TODO Binary installs also need to ensure that dependency packages are also installed.
    We can manage this using our app.json in a future update.
** TODO Improve Bash / coreutils bootstrapping on macOS, automatically installing missing dependencies.
    Need to run something like this:
    PATH="${TMPDIR}/koopa-bootstrap/bin:${PATH}" \
        koopa install --all
** TODO Consider linking koopa into /usr/local/bin.
** TODO Consider linking bash into /usr/local/bin on macOS (only if Homebrew doesn't have one there).
    This improves compatibility with RStudio `system2` calls, which currently hardcode `/usr/local` and ignore `/opt/koopa`.

    Rework install functions to use this.
** TODO Move all installer link and unlink operations to 'include/installers' script instead.
** TODO Ensure that 'koopa install --help' works.
** TODO Need to add 'koopa update system' support for Linux distros.
** TODO Reorganize installation of system packages under 'koopa install system XXX'.
    e.g. update this for Homebrew, etc.

** TODO Consider adding r-cli style inline markup support for CLI messages.
    https://cli.r-lib.org/reference/inline-markup.html
    The default theme defines the following inline classes:
    - 'arg' for a function argument.
    - 'cls' for an S3, S4, R6 or other class name.
    - 'code' for a piece of code.
    - 'dd' is used for the descriptions in a definition list (cli_dl()).
    - 'dt' is used for the terms in a definition list (cli_dl()).
    - 'email' for an email address.
    - 'emph' for emphasized text.
    - 'envvar' for the name of an environment variable.
    - 'field' for a generic field, e.g. in a named list.
    - 'file' for a file name.
    - 'fun' for a function name.
    - 'key' for a keyboard key.

    - 'pkg' for a package name.
    - 'strong' for strong importance.
    - 'url' for a URL.

** TODO Consider clean up of '/etc/paths.d' and '/etc/manpaths.d' on macOS for Homebrew casks.
    Ubuntu uses '/etc/environment' for paths configuration.
    https://towardsdatascience.com/my-path-variable-is-a-mess-e52f22bfa520
** TODO Consider linking some koopa tools into /opt/koopa/sbin instead of bin.

    https://github.com/Wilfred/difftastic
    https://github.com/darrenburns/dunk
** TODO libtool version check is now failing.
** TODO Work on caching Bash functions into a single file.

    - Need to incude shebang at the top. How to prepend a file in Bash?
** TODO Can we rework system permissions to only use admin group but not root user?
** TODO Boost version detection isn't working on Ubuntu.
** TODO Need to rethink our link approach, putting useful tools in top level bin.
    This mimics the approach of Homebrew, without linking into /usr/local.
    Should we not put ANY tools linked into /usr/local?
** TODO Need to reorganize pre-built app tarballs by processor architecture.
** TODO Rework our conda-based NGS utilites by locating the programs directly, rather than by activating conda inside a function.
** TODO Improve consistency of AWS functions.
    - Ensure that all input consistently requires 's3://' as prefix input.
    - Ensure that this is consistent for CLI parser to JSON...bucket API one
** TODO Improve 'koopa uninstall app' to support removal of specific previous versions.
    - Pass this in with '--version' argument.
    - Need to support removal of older app versions.
    - In the case where it's not current link in opt, don't remove the opt link.

    /opt/koopa/app/dotfiles/rolling/app/coc/extensions/node_modules
** TODO Add improved stack trace of error messages.
** TODO Before pushing changes, ensure sed with '--quiet' change is non breaking.
** TODO Syntactic naming functions need an option to also convert the extension to lowercase.
** TODO Shared install isn't setting user permissions recursively correctly.
    Need to ensure that '/opt/koopa' isn't owned by current user after install.
    We're seeing this currently on AWS EC2 instances.
** TODO Confirm that not all bash functions load on interactive session.
** TODO Rework 'koopa install XXX --reinstall' flag to 'koopa reinstall XXX' instead, similar to approach used in Homebrew.
** TODO Emacs version check is now failing on old MacBook.
** TODO texinfo check is now failing again on old MacBook.
    Seeing 6.7 instead of expected 6.8, due to another program dumping into /usr/local.

** TODO Improve install instructions on website to provide recommended default
   packages for Debian (apt) and Fedora (yum).
** TODO User permissions on Debian 11 clean install are 'admin:admin' instead
   of 'root:admin', which we're expecting. Need to fix.
** TODO Dotifles are not installing clean on fresh Debian 11 AMI.

** TODO Need a simple batch rename utility to convert file extension to
    lowercase. We may simply add this in a future update to syntactic engine.
** TODO photos_rename_exiftool needs to error on file input instead of
    directory more clearly.
** TODO Ensure that no dict arrays contain '$dict' variable usage inside the
    initial array call. This doesn't work in Bash. Double check this before
    merging develop branch.
