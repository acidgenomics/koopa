# """
# Homebrew Bundle Brewfile.
# Updated 2021-09-14.
# 
# Shared across macOS and Linux.
#
# LLVM:
# LLVM takes up 4 GB of disk space but is required for some Python packages.
# In particular, if we want to install umap-learn, this is now required.
#
# PROJ/GDAL:
# Consider using 'osgeo-gdal' instead of regular 'gdal' brew. This one gets
# updated more regularly. However, I've found that the newer version can
# cause some R packages to fail to build from source.
#
# Rust:
# Use cargo to manage packages instead.
# Use the 'install-rust' script instead of Homebrew 'rustup-init'.
# Don't install 'rust' alongside 'rustup-init'.

# Problematic formulas:
# - lapack
# - libiconv
# - libressl
#
# Formula without bottles:
# - emacs
# - proj?
# - gdal
# - mariadb-connector-c
# - openssh
#
# GCC warnings:
# - protobuf
#
# Maybe include:
# - podofo
#
# Consider:
# - miniforge
