.SH NAME
fastq-dump-from-sra-file-list \-
FASTQ dump from Sequence Read Archive (SRA) accession list
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fastq-dump-from-sra-file-list
[filelist="SRR_Acc_List.txt"]
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B filelist
SRA access file list.
.SH DESCRIPTION
Requires sratools to be installed, which contains fastq-dump.
.P
This script loops across an SRA accession file list and calls 'fastq-dump --split-files' internally.
.P
Note that this will skip FASTQ files that have already been extracted. This is useful because fastq-dump can take a long time and get interrupted.
.SH SEE ALSO
Use fasterq-dump instead of fastq-dump, since it supports multiple threads.
