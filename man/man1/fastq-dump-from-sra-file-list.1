    [filelist="${filelist}"]

FASTQ dump from Sequence Read Archive (SRA) accession list.

optional positional arguments:
    1.  SRA access file list.
        Defaults to '${filelist}'.

$(_koopa_help_args)

details:
    Requires sratools to be installed, which contains fastq-dump.

    This script loops across an SRA accession file list and calls 
    'fastq-dump --split-files' internally.

    Note that this will skip FASTQ files that have already been extracted.
    This is useful because fastq-dump can take a long time and get interrupted.

see also:
    Look into using fasterq-dump instead of fastq-dump.
    Consider using '--split-3' flag by default instead?
