Copy BAM and BAI index sidecar files from a source to a target directory.

required positional arguments:
    1.  Source directory path, containing BAM files.
    2.  Target directory path.


details:
    Supports transfers on file systems with non-standard permissions, including
    Azure Files and Windows CIFS/SMB shares.

    We're allowing symlinks in the search path (via 'find -L' internally).

    Note that we're ignoring some bcbio output cruft here.
    Skip transfer of BAM files in the 'work/' directory, and don't copy any
    of the transcriptome BAMs automatically.

    Ignore list:
    - 'work/'
    - '*-transcriptome.bam'

    rsync works more reliably for resuming interrupted transfers. Currently
    using this to transfer to Azure Files

    Alternate method:
    > cp -iruv source target

examples:
    copy-bam-files bam/ /data00/bam/

note:
    Bash script.
