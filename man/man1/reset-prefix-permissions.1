Reset build prefix permissions.


details:
    Recursively reset user and group permissions on default target build
    prefix directory. Primarily intended for use with cellar install scripts.

    Group write access will be enabled.

    For a shared installation, 'root:root' permissions are often too
    restrictive and hard to manage, so we're enabling admin group write access.

internal variables:
    prefix: '${prefix}'
    user: '${user}'
    group: '${group}'

note:
    Bash script.
