Install (cellar-only) OpenSSL.

$(_koopa_help_args)

details:
    Currently installing as cellar-only.

    This is useful for running RDAVIDWebService on a virtual machine but can
    break other programs when installed into '/usr/local'.

    Alternatively, can consider using OpenSSL available via conda.
