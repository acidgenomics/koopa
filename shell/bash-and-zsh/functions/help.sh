    # Zsh parameter notes:
    # - '$0': The name used to invoke the current shell, or as set by the -c
    #   command line option upon invocation. If the FUNCTION_ARGZERO option is
    #   set, $0 is set upon entry to a shell function to the name of the
    #   function, and upon entry to a sourced script to the name of the script,
    #   and reset to its previous value when the function or script returns.
    # - 'FUNCTION_ARGZERO': When executing a shell function or sourcing a
    #   script, set $0 temporarily to the name of the function/script. Note that
    #   toggling FUNCTION_ARGZERO from on to off (or off to on) does not change
    #   the current value of $0. Only the state upon entry to the function or
    #   script has an effect. Compare POSIX_ARGZERO.
    # - 'POSIX_ARGZERO': This option may be used to temporarily disable
    #   FUNCTION_ARGZERO and thereby restore the value of $0 to the name used to
    #   invoke the shell (or as set by the -c command line option). For
    #   compatibility with previous versions of the shell, emulations use
    #   NO_FUNCTION_ARGZERO instead of POSIX_ARGZERO, which may result in
    #   unexpected scoping of $0 if the emulation mode is changed inside a
    #   function or script. To avoid this, explicitly enable POSIX_ARGZERO in
    #   the emulate command:
    #
    #   emulate sh -o POSIX_ARGZERO
    #
    #   Note that NO_POSIX_ARGZERO has no effect unless FUNCTION_ARGZERO was
    #   already enabled upon entry to the function or script.
