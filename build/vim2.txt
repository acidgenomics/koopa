# Installation

On [macOS][], I recommend using [Homebrew][]. On Linux, I recommend building and installing from source.

## Build and install from source

Here's how to build [Vim][] on a Linux machine that supports [yum][]. First, we need to install all of the dependencies that were used to build vim.

```bash
sudo yum -y install yum-utils
sudo yum-builddep -y vim
```

Clone the vim source code.

```bash
version="8.1.0847"
wget "https://github.com/vim/vim/archive/v${version}.tar.gz"
tar -xzvf "v${version}.tar.gz"
cd "vim-${version}"
```

```bash
./configure --prefix="/usr/local"
make
sudo make install
```

Alternatively, here's how to install without `sudo`.

```bash
./configure --prefix="${HOME}/.local"
make
make install
```

Check the version.

```bash
vim --version
```
