<h1>CloudBioLinux Deployer CloudMan QuickStart</h1>

<p>As far as I can determine there is no current documentation on how to build
CloudMan instances from scratch. Thus I am collecting my unofficial notes on
how to do this here - spefically using the CloudBioLinux deployer.</p>

<p>You will need to navigate the AWS management console and obtain the following
information.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>access_id</code></li>
<li><code>secret_key</code></li>
<li>Ubuntu EBS-backed AMI ID to target. This writeup was tested with ami-9b85eef2 (12.04.2 (64-bit) in us-east-1)</li>
<li>Image size to use (e.g. m1-small)</li>
<li>Availibity zone (e.g. us-east-1)</li>
<li>You will need to setup a bucket to store your snaps file, here you will need the bucket name.</li>
<li>You will need to setup two volumes in your target availibity zone, one for
Galaxy tools and data (perhaps 20Gb for testing) and one for galaxyIndices. Here you will need the volume ids.</li>
<li>Generate a private a key (e.g. galaxy1.pem) and copy it into keys directory (or anywhere really), 
also note the keypair_name corresponding to the key.</li>
</ul>

<p>Create a directory (e.g. <code>/home/mary/marys_cloudman_bucket_contents</code>). Copy
the files from an existing CloudMan bucket here (e.g. http://s3.amazonaws.com
/cloudman-dev).</p>

<p>It is not really important how you download these files, but one quick option
is to use <code>s3cmd</code> tool:</p>

<pre><code>% sudo apt-get install s3cmd  # Or your OS's package manager
% mkdir /home/mary/marys_cloudman_bucket_contents
% s3cmd -r get s3://cloudman-dev marys_cloudman_bucket_contents
</code></pre>

<p>Here you can update cm.tar.gz or any of these files to match the customized
setup you would like. In particular you are going to want to create a custom
snaps.yaml file. Here is a simple outline that we will fill out as we good.</p>

<pre><code>version: 1
clouds:
  - name: amazon
    regions:
    - deployments:
      - name: GalaxyCloud
        filesystems:
        - name: galaxy
          roles: galaxyTools,galaxyData
          snap_id: snap-XXXXXXXXXXX
        - name: galaxyIndices
          roles: galaxyIndices
          snap_id: snap-XXXXXXXXXXXX
        default_mi: ami-XXXXXXXXXXXXX
        bucket: marys_cloudman_bucket
      name: us-east-1
</code></pre>

<p>Immediately this template can be updated to reflect the bucket created above
and the availibity zone you are targetting. We can update teh snap<em>id's and
the default</em>mi after creating them.</p>

<p>Copy and modify <code>settings.yaml</code>:</p>

<pre><code>% cp settings-sample-cm.yaml settings.yaml
% vim settings.yaml # or your favorite editor
</code></pre>

<p>Carefully scan through that file and change the properties marked as requiring
change. The keyword <code>UPDATE</code> indicates properties of special interest that
either don't have reasonable defaults or have reasonable defaults but that I
have deemed highly likely to be overridden.</p>

<p>Now you can use the CloudBioLinux deployer to launch an image, attach volumes,
install biolinux, take needed snapshots, and package the whole thing up:</p>

<pre><code>% ./deploy.sh --action=launch
% ./deploy.sh --action=attach_volumes
% ./deploy.sh --action=install_biolinux --flavor=cloudman/cloudman_and_galaxy
% ./deploy.sh --action=snapshot_volumes
% ./deploy.sh --action=detach_volumes
% ./deploy.sh --action=package
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, update snaps.yaml in your bucket directory (e.g.
<code>/home/mary/marys_cloudman_bucket_contents</code>) to reflect the snap_ids and AMI's
just created. These should all be available via the AWS console or by
reviewing the output of the steps above.</p>

<p>Finally, you can upload your new bucket and launch a test CloudMan instance:</p>

<pre><code>% ./deploy.sh --action=sync_cloudman_bucket
% ./deploy.sh --action=cloudman_launch
</code></pre>
