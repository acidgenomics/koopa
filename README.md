Shell bootloader for bioinformatics.

## Requirements

- Linux or macOS. Windows isn't supported.
- [Bash][] 4 (`bash --version`)
- [Python][] 3 (`python --version`)

[Zsh][] support may be added in a future update. I'm looking into it.

## Installation

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/steinbaugh/koopa.git ~/koopa
```

Second, add these lines to `~/.bash_profile`:

```bash
# koopa shell
# https://github.com/steinbaugh/koopa
source ~/koopa/bin/koopa activate
```

Koopa should now activate at login.

To obtain information about the working environment, run `koopa info`.

Since workload managers (e.g. [Slurm][], [LSF][]) can spawn non-interactive login shells for new jobs, we recommend additionally symlinking `~/.bashrc` to `~/.bash_profile`. For non-interactive login shells, koopa doesn't attempt to print any messages, so the shell remains clean.
