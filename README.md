High-performance computing shell bootloader for bioinformatics.


## Installation

Connect to your high-performance computing (HPC) cluster and clone our git repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/seqcloud/seqcloud.git ~/seqcloud
```

Add these lines to your `.bashrc` file:

```bash
# seqcloud
if [[ -n "$PS1" ]] && [[ -f ~/seqcloud/seqcloud.sh ]]; then
    . ~/seqcloud/seqcloud.sh
fi
```

To also load seqcloud on a login node, we recommend symlinking your `.bashrc` file to `.bash_profile`:

```bash
ln -s ~/.bashrc ~/.bash_profile
```


## Interactive session

To launch an interactive session, simply run:

```bash
seqcloud interactive -c <cores> -m <memory> -t <time>
```

For example, here's how to start an interactive session for 6 hours using 2 cores and 8 GB of RAM per core, on an HPC using the [slurm] scheduler:

```bash
seqcloud interactive -c 2 -m 8 -t 0-06:00
```
