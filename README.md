Shell bootloader for bioinformatics.

## Installation

Bash shell running on either Linux or macOS is currently supported.

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/steinbaugh/koopa.git ~/koopa
```

Second, add these lines to `~/.bash_profile`:

```bash
# koopa shell
# https://github.com/steinbaugh/koopa
source ~/koopa/bin/koopa activate
```

Koopa should now activate at login. To obtain information on the current working enviroment, simply run `koopa info`.

## High-performance computing (HPC) environment

Koopa currently supports [Slurm][] and [IBM Platform LSF][LSF] workload managers.

Since workload managers can spawn non-interactive login shells for new jobs, we recommend additionally symlinking `~/.bashrc` to `~/.bash_profile`. For non-interactive login shells, koopa doesn't attempt to print any messages, so the shell remains clean.

### Interactive jobs

To launch an interactive job on an HPC cluster, simply run the `interactive` script. All arguments are optional, but generally we recommend setting the number of cores, memory, and time.

```bash
koopa interactive --cores=[N] --mem=[GB] --time=[D-HH::MM]
```

For example, here's how to start an interactive job on an HPC running [Slurm][], which will run for 6 hours using 2 cores and 16 GB of RAM total (i.e. 8 GB per core).

```bash
koopa interactive --cores=2 --mem=16 --time=0-06:00
```

For more information on supported arguments, consult `koopa interactive --help`.
