Shell bootloader for bioinformatics.

## Installation

Bash shell running on either Linux or macOS is currently supported.

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/steinbaugh/koopa.git ~/koopa
```

Second, add these lines to `~/.bash_profile`:

```bash
# koopa shell
# https://github.com/steinbaugh/koopa
source ~/koopa/bin/koopa activate
```

Koopa should now activate at login. To obtain information on the current working enviroment, simply run `koopa info`.

## High-performance computing (HPC) environment

Since workload managers (e.g. [Slurm][], [LSF][]) can spawn non-interactive login shells for new jobs, we recommend additionally symlinking `~/.bashrc` to `~/.bash_profile`. For non-interactive login shells, koopa doesn't attempt to print any messages, so the shell remains clean.
